# 🧩 Quick Platform Categories (Playnite Extension)
✨ Automatically create and assign platform/source categories to your games for faster filtering in Playnite.
Perfect for large libraries, emulator setups, and mixed platforms.

This extension automatically assigns each game to categories based on its platform or source, including short user-defined names (e.g. Sony PlayStation 2 → PS2) making it easy to keep your library organized—especially after importing new games.
 
### ➡️ Why use it?
- It allows you to quickly filter games across different platforms in a much more intuitive and responsive way compared to Playnite's built-in "Platform" and "Library" filters, which can be slow and uncomfortable considering:
  - the sidebar must stay open
  - platform panel is small and require scrolling
  - changing from one system (e.g. Amiga) to another (e.g. PS2) takes several clicks
  - having many platforms results in a long list
- Using categories instead:
  - is faster
  - is more visible
  - requires fewer clicks
  - works perfectly with grid view
  - makes switching between platform-based categories and thematic ones (e.g. “Horror”) immediate.  
  
  This is especially useful if you use emulators or have a mixed-platform collection.

### ⚙️ How it works:

- In Platforms.txt you can specify short game's platform names for the categories (for example: Nintendo Entertainment System -> Nintendo NES, Sony Playstation 2 -> Sony PS2, etc).
- You can also add sources like Ea App, Ubisoft Connect and add short names (like Origin, Uplay) or whatever you want.   
- If there's no category for an imported game's platform/source, a new category with platform/source's name will be created.
- Existing categories will not be deleted and the new category will be added to them.
- If a game has multiple platforms checked in Playnite, only the first platform will be considered for adding/creating the category.
- In Platforms.txt and Source.txt there are already some platforms and sources. You can edit these two files without having to reload the extension.  
- In future I'll add the possibility to specify and add more categories per platform (for example: Nintendo Game Boy Color -> Nintendo Game Boy; Nintendo Game Boy Color).


If you enjoy the extension, you can buy me a coffee. It will be very appreciated ;)
