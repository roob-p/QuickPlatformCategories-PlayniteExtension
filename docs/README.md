# 🧩 Quick Platform Categories (Playnite Extension)
✨ Automatically create and assign platform/source categories to your games for faster filtering in Playnite.
Perfect for large libraries, emulator setups, and mixed platforms.

This extension automatically assigns each game to categories based on its platform or source, including short user-defined names (e.g. Sony PlayStation 2 → PS2) making it easy to keep your library organized, especially after importing new games.
 
### ➡️ Why this extension exists:
- It allows you to quickly filter games across different platforms in a much more intuitive and responsive way compared to Playnite's built-in "Platform" and "Library" filters, which can be slow and uncomfortable considering:
  - the sidebar must stay open
  - platform panel is small and requires scrolling
  - changing from one system (e.g. Amiga) to another (e.g. PS2) takes several clicks
  - having many platforms results in a long list
- Using categories instead:
  - is faster
  - is more visible
  - requires fewer clicks
  - works perfectly with grid view
  - makes switching between platform-based categories and thematic ones (e.g. “Horror”) immediate.  
  
  **This is especially useful if you use emulators or have a mixed-platform collection.**

### ⚙️ How it works:

- The extension assigns categories to each selected game based on its platform and source, using the definitions in `Platforms.txt` and `Source.txt`.
- You can define short, user-friendly names for platforms (e.g. Nintendo Entertainment System → NES) and sources (e.g. EA App → Origin).
- If a category for a platform or source is not defined, it will be created with the platform/source name.
- Existing categories are never deleted.
- Games with multiple platforms will only be assigned to the first platform listed in Playnite.
- `Platforms.txt` and `Source.txt` can be edited at any time. No need to reload the extension.


If you enjoy the extension, you can buy me a coffee. It will be very appreciated ;)
